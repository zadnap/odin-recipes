    <h2>Allrecipes Community Tips and Praise</h2>
    <p>“Whole family enjoyed these,” says Sharon H. “I took the easy way out due to time and used a packet of taco seasoning instead of the individual seasonings. Doubled the recipe and put the pizzas on cookie sheets.”</p>
    <p>“So yummy,” raves Stefani Anderson. “I omitted the meat as we’re vegetarian and just added the spices to the onions and garlic while they were sautéing. I’ll definitely make it again!”</p>
    <p>“This pizza satisfied my craving for a light Mexican meal,” says Sandi. “I made this for lunch today. Super easy. Instead of two pie plates, I used a rectangular glass baking dish.”</p>

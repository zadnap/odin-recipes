    <h2>What is Pho?</h2>
    <p>Pho is a soup consisting of bone broth, rice noodles, thinly-sliced meat (in this recipe, it's beef), and fresh garnishes.</p>
    <h2>Where is Pho From?</h2>
    <p>As with many foods, the origins of pho are unknown. It is believed to have been created in northern Vietnam in the early 20th century. It gained popularity in many countries after the Vietnam War.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Beef Soup Bones: Use the shank and knee to make the homemade bone broth.</li>
        <li>Rice Noodles: You should be able to find dry rice noodles at most grocery stores, either in the international aisle or another pantry aisle.</li>
        <li>Beef: This recipe calls for beef top sirloin. Make sure it's thinly sliced so the hot broth can cook it.</li>
        <li>Fish Sauce: Fish sauce will give the pho a hint of salty, fishy flavor.</li>
        <li>Onion: Roast the onions for an extra depth of flavor.</li>
        <li>Spices and Seasonings: This recipe calls for ginger, star anise, and salt.</li>
        <li>Garnishes: Garnish your pho with cilantro, green onion, Thai basil, lime, hoisin sauce, sriracha, or anything else you like.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
